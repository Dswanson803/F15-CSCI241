The PRG Pattern is a redirect method used to prevent double posting problems. It works by
having the user submission to be sent as a POST request. Once this has gone through you
redirect using a GET request which sends the conformation page. This redirect prevents users
from making errors such as refreshing the webpage, and resubmitting the POST request that is
taking money from them, or something along those lines.

To fix a PRG error, you can include a header() function to redirect the user.
